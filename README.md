## Rationale for development

I belong to a group of 5-6 20 something friends whose primary hobby is gaming, as such we all have steam accounts with each of us owning at least 200 games. We all prefer to play games together, we dont mind replaying games, including older games, if it means we can play together. We would occasionally ask what games we have in common, however since steam only allows users to compare their lists with one other user at a time this task was very tedious. I wanted more excuses to practice on REST API's so I researched Steam's API and once I discovered it was feasible to make a tool that could compare multiple users lists for common games I decided to make this tool.

## REST API

The REST API is a spring boot project (created using spring initializr) run using a Tomcat server. The API is exposed (by default) on port 8080, it currently only has two endpoints. The primary endpoint is a POST endpoint which takes a json object consisting of an array of ids which correspond to Steam User Id's (these are publicly available, either by using the Steam client or through the Steam API) it also takes a boolean parameter to flag whether only multiplayer games should be returned in the result set

An example of the body of the post request is:
```
{
	"steamIds" : [76561198045206229,76561198014258751,76561198171740181,76561198069846749],
	"multiplayerOnly": true
}
```

Upon success the API will return a json object consisting of game objects that contain the game's Application Id on the Steam db as well as the game's name . The returned games are multiplyer games the users entered in the input have in common.

An example of the output of ther API is:
```
[
    {
       "appid": 730,
       "name": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"
    },
    {
        "appid": 218230,
        "name": "PlanetSide 2"
    }
]
```

There is also a swagger endpoint on the root of port 8080 if you want to view documentation in swagger format

## UI

The UI is made with React with components from the ant design UI framework, all running on an node.js server. The UI allows the user to enter a number of steam id's and search for the common games between the users, there is some simple validation preventing the user from entering invalid steam id's. I've also added some Qol features such allowing the user to remove users from the search list. Once a search is performed a new panel will appear that, upon success of the fetch will display a scrollable table of the users common games, this table will have two columns; one in which the image of the game will be displayed (pulled from steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net) and the second which will display the games name, this doubles as a link to the game's Steam store page.

## Docker

Both the API and UI have docker images ready for containerization

I've also included a simple docker-compose file at the root of the project for easy setup/shutdown


## Things to improve

I'd prefer not to spend too much more time on this project as I could likely spend weeks refactoring and upgrading this project, I prefer to set myself a time limit with these sort of one-offs. But if I was going to go back I improve the following:

- [ ] Creation and documentation of SGGCXXXX error codes errors returned from the API, for easier consuming
- [x] Logging to a file within the project, for easier debugging
- [ ] Adding security features
- [ ] More testing, or really any testing, bad practice :(.
- [ ] refactoring
